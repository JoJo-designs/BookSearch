  ### Usage
  When users navigate to the website they can start by looking for books right away or they can create and account. If a user already has an account they can login. When logged in users can add books and log out.

  ### Missing
  The goal of this assignment was to convert a working app into an apollo and graphql. I found this pretty difficult to do so a few things are missing. The first function that I am missing is the capability to view all the books a user has added. along with the views the delete function that is also built in the views is missing. and the log out works but it was not converted.
